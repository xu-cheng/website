I recently gave a tutorial on how to use the LaTeX. You can find the slides [here](https://gh.xuc.me/latex-tutorial/slides.pdf). To complement the tutorial slides, I also create an example project to highlight some LaTeX usages. The source code for both the slides and the example are available in [Github](https://github.com/xu-cheng/latex-tutorial).
